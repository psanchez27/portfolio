    <h1>Rediscovering Your Passion for Coding</h1>

    It seems so easy to fall into the trap of going through the motions. As problem solvers, it becomes instinct for us to find the best solution to a problem, then repeat. We write an efficient algorithm and use it over and over. Sure it works, but if we’re not careful we can get pulled into the wheel of repetition. Whether you're stuck following tutorials or you’ve been coding for years and working the field, repetitions can lead to hurt.

    For me it was tutorial hell. I was eager to learn, a good thing, but watching one video after another drained me. Sure I loved the content, but it was overwhelming taking in so much information without actually developing and practicing those skills. So much in fact, I'd take long breaks from coding. Before I knew it, one day passed without coding, then one week, two, three, months even passed by. Why? Is this not for me? Do I not like coding? Well turns out, I do. I love creating applications; however, watching videos all day hoping to finally have enough knowledge, leaves no time for productive practice. That's where the discouragement came from.

  <h3>How do we break this cycle?</h3>

    I will never feel ready. What is ready? The feeling of being competent in what you do? Well that's tough, it seems like there is always another library or framework to learn. I’m a prideful guy. I enjoy knowing everything. My wife likes to remind me I’m that way. Now this isn’t all bad. I am extremely driven to reach goals, passionate about progress. Does that sound bad? Not necessarily. However, when my eagerness to do everything perfectly blinds me from reality, it becomes a problem. What is the reality? I have been “ready” for a long time. Just because I’m not a “pro” at this or fluent enough in that, doesn’t mean I can’t make a good application. Once I realized this, I stepped away from the tutorials and began to work. I decided to make Applications that I wasn’t sure I could do at the time - completed one, then another. I realized Just because I wasn’t sure if I could do something, doesn’t mean I shouldn’t start. When I realized this, it fired up my passion. I wanted to make everything. And yes, I will always have new puzzles to solve. The tutorials never stop, technology is always changing, but It is extremely important to face those challenges and do what we love without fear. Create apps.

    The takeaway is this, tutorials are great. But they are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. Though we can be passionate about learning, our true passion and a majority of learning lies in coding itself - creating applications that challenge us. Always keep a vision of that first love.
