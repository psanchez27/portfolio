    <h1>Getting new ideas for projects</h1>

      So you’ve just followed a tutorial and successfully figured out the course project. Endorphins flood your brain with thoughts of the many possibilities using this newly acquired technology. Now what? Sure, making another calculator app would help solidify the knowledge, but how will calculators keep your mind excited and growing? Recreating old projects could drain your passion for creating apps. So how do we choose projects that keep the juices flowing?

      Good apps simplify everyday tasks, or fill a need. They are meant to make life easier and more enjoyable. People use apps for practical purposes, like budgeting and GPS and for entertainment. If these are the original sparks for app development, why not try and create apps we ourselves deem useful? Let’s create something we are passionate about.

    <h3>Brainstorming for Ideas:</h3>
    <p class="post">
      What things do you enjoy doing / do often? I personally enjoy working on cars. It’s something I grew up watching my dad do. When I got my first car handed down from my sister - a1999 Infiniti I30 - the dashboard lit up with hieroglyphics. We tackled those countless car projects together, working out puzzle after puzzle. It became our thing.

      At first, it took me some time to remember the make, model, engine specifics, or trim when buying replacement parts. How was I supposed to know every obscure specification? It was those embarrassing moments at the auto parts store that led me to create an app where when you enter the car’s VIN, it returns a series of helpful information on your car.

    <h3>Free APIs:</h3>
    <p class="post">
      I love searching through lists and lists of free API’s. Why rack your brain for an idea from nothing when there are countless API’s. When you find an API that sparks your interest, it will also return information that could be useful for an app. There are many resources out there that give you access to free (or extremely cheap) APIs. One I really like is rapidAPI. They categorize their APIs to help users on their search. If you are into sports, food or a huge variety of other topics, search it on Rapid API. It is usually as simple as finding an API and thinking, “It'd be cool if there was an app for that.”
